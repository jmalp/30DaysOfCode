# 30DaysOfCode
The goal of this repository is to serve as a log of all the coding done for 30 days. This is a self-challenge to elevate my knowledge of software engineering with anything related to coding wether it is Leetcode style problems, personal projects, or learning a new language or technology. I will update this log daily with what I learned that day and how I feel about it.
